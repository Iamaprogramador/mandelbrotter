Thank you for downloading my program. I hope you use it a lot.
Since I am providing this software free of charge, I ask that you please give me credit for this software.
Please also provide the GitHub link to the repo (github.com/Iamaprogramador/mandelbrot-zoom).
If you are interested in seeing how the output of this program appears, see some example videos at my YouTube channel, Iamaprogramador.
How to use:
You should be using a Linux machine. If you are not, you can still run this program using a Linux virtual machine.
If you want to do that, install the app VirtualBox and add a (preferably Debian or Ubuntu-based) Linux machine.
You should have ffmpeg installed on your system.
If it is not, simply execute the command 'sudo apt-get install ffmpeg'.
You can then run the program by running the command './zoom.sh'.
However, I suggest first opening that file and editing the parameters to your wish.
Soon I will include better instructions on how to change the coloring.
For now, though, happy fractals!
